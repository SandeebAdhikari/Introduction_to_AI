<p t="1340" d="3220">This is the largest green roof in New York City.</p>
<p t="4720" d="5320">It&#39;s in the middle of bustling Manhattan, on top of the Javits Convention Centerâ€”</p>
<p t="10220" d="3480">a behemoth of a building with a six-block footprint.</p>
<p t="13700" d="2780">But the roof hasn&#39;t always been green.</p>
<p t="16480" d="3700">Before 2014, it was totally barren.</p>
<p t="20180" d="3700">Now, just a few years later, when people walk out onto the roof, they say things like:</p>
<p t="24000" d="3940">&quot;Amazing,&quot; &quot;That&#39;s great,&quot; &quot;I didn&#39;t expect this,&quot; &quot;What a surprise.&quot;</p>
<p t="28100" d="3840">But besides the great reactions, there are practical benefits.</p>
<p t="31940" d="2280">We have 300,000 bees.</p>
<p t="34360" d="2400">We&#39;ve seen 25 different species of birds on the roof.</p>
<p t="36860" d="2840">We reduced the temperature up here by about six degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p t="39700" d="3800">And we also save about 7 million gallons of stormwater runoff</p>
<p t="43580" d="2860">that&#39;s absorbed in the soil and the plants that are on our roof.</p>
<p t="46440" d="4120">We&#39;ve been able to reduce our energy
consumption by about 26 percent,</p>
<p t="50560" d="5380">and that translated for us last year
into a saving of about 3 million dollars.</p>
<p t="55940" d="2240">That is impressive.</p>
<p t="58180" d="3220">How does one green roof get so much done?</p>
<p t="61540" d="4400">And what are all of the NOT green roofs in New York City doing with their lives?</p>
<p t="66100" d="3480">First, let&#39;s see how much roof space actually exists.</p>
<p t="69800" d="3120">You know, they are a major part of urban landscapes.</p>
<p t="72920" d="5400">The the round number that most of us think exists is about 1 billion square feet.</p>
<p t="78440" d="1620">One billion with a &#39;b.&#39;</p>
<p t="80240" d="3920">That&#39;s like 22 times the size of Central Park, in roofs.</p>
<p t="84160" d="4980">And in most cities, what isn&#39;t roof is another impermeable surface</p>
<p t="89160" d="2500">like road, sidewalk, or parking
lot.</p>
<p t="91840" d="3620">And these surfaces create a lot of problems for cities</p>
<p t="95640" d="2420">That green roofs can actually help solve.</p>
<p t="98060" d="4260">Let&#39;s take a look at three of these issues. The first is
stormwater runoff.</p>
<p t="102440" d="6300">Rainwater goes in pipes. It combines
with what&#39;s called sanitary water.</p>
<p t="108740" d="4720">When there&#39;s too much rainwater, which happens hundreds of times a year around Manhattan,</p>
<p t="113460" d="3600">the wastewater treatment
systems shut down, and valves just let</p>
<p t="117060" d="4080">the water just,  you know, shunt out into the rivers. You know, it&#39;s got human sewage.</p>
<p t="121140" d="3200">It&#39;s the biggest source of pathogens to
the Manhattan Island.</p>
<p t="124340" d="5680">With green roofs, that water instead of going into the
drain and polluting the environment,</p>
<p t="130160" d="3300">ends up just evaporating the atmosphere
through the leaves of these plants.</p>
<p t="133460" d="2800">And then, there&#39;s what scientists call the &quot;heat island effect,&quot;</p>
<p t="136380" d="4360">which basically means that cities are significantly warmer than the surrounding areas.</p>
<p t="140880" d="6080">I&#39;ve seen asphalt roofs get up easily 170, 180 degrees Fahrenheit in the strong sunlight.</p>
<p t="146960" d="3820">They absorb about 90 to 95 percent of the sunlight.</p>
<p t="150780" d="3600">Green roofs, by comparison are close to air temperatures.</p>
<p t="154480" d="3480">Another problem green roofs can help solve is habitat loss.</p>
<p t="157960" d="5560">Cities can shrink or destroy the green space that&#39;s crucial for certain plants and
animals to survive.</p>
<p t="163580" d="5660">Currently a lot of species might occur in  smaller parks throughout the city that are relatively unconnected,</p>
<p t="169240" d="4680">But having high densities of green roofs would allow those patches to be more connected.</p>
<p t="173920" d="5680">Letting, for example, butterflies travel from patch to patch with lots of stepping stones of green roofs in between.</p>
<p t="179600" d="4020">And these are just three of the problems that green roofs can help solve.</p>
<p t="183620" d="3180">But to really put a dent in any of these issues</p>
<p t="186820" d="2700">cities would have to implement green roofs at a large scale.</p>
<p t="189600" d="3280">Stuart Gaffin, the research scientist
you heard from earlier,</p>
<p t="192920" d="4620">estimates that if all of New York City&#39;s 1 billion square feet of roof space were greened,</p>
<p t="197540" d="4900">those green roofs could lower the city&#39;s
temperature by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit</p>
<p t="202440" d="5100">and absorb over 10 billion
gallons of stormwater each year.</p>
<p t="207540" d="7100">As cities continue to grow, all that empty roof space starts to look more and more like an opportunity,</p>
<p t="214640" d="1840">an untapped resource,</p>
<p t="216600" d="4460">a future ecosystem of problem-solving meadows</p>
<p t="221140" d="9580">in the sky.</p>
