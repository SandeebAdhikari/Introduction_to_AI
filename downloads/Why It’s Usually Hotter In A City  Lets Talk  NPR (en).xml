<p t="4480" d="3700">There’s a reason that summers in the city are so hot,</p>
<p t="8180" d="1500">and it’s probably easiest to explain why</p>
<p t="9680" d="1700">with thermal vision.</p>
<p t="11380" d="2100">It shows the heat all around me</p>
<p t="13480" d="2540">and also the coldness of this ice cream cone.</p>
<p t="16900" d="2760">Cities are often hotter than their suburbs</p>
<p t="19660" d="4540">due to a phenomenon known as “the heat island effect.”</p>
<p t="24200" d="1380">All of that asphalt,</p>
<p t="25580" d="680">concrete,</p>
<p t="26260" d="1020">dark rooftops</p>
<p t="27280" d="1420">and tall buildings—</p>
<p t="28700" d="2580">they absorb and store heat.</p>
<p t="31420" d="2640">And there are a lot of people using a lot of energy—</p>
<p t="34060" d="4160">driving cars, riding subways, running the AC.</p>
<p t="38440" d="2540">All of these materials and activities</p>
<p t="40980" d="2800">either create or retain heat.</p>
<p t="44900" d="3460">And all that stored heat causes steeper nighttime highs …</p>
<p t="48360" d="3200">when people would otherwise have a chance to cool down.</p>
<p t="52160" d="3520">The way all these heat-storing elements are laid out</p>
<p t="55680" d="1880">matters quite a bit.</p>
<p t="57560" d="1500">In cities laid out in grids,</p>
<p t="59060" d="2860">like Phoenix, Chicago, or Washington, D.C.,</p>
<p t="61940" d="2160">the buildings are closer together,</p>
<p t="64100" d="2900">like closely packed coals in a fire, keeping heat in.</p>
<p t="67000" d="1660">More space between buildings</p>
<p t="68660" d="2640">creates more circulation.</p>
<p t="71380" d="2780">Another way to combat this heat island effect</p>
<p t="74160" d="1460">is through green space.</p>
<p t="75620" d="2260">Parks, trees, plants—</p>
<p t="77880" d="1500">they don’t absorb as much heat …</p>
<p t="79380" d="2540">they actually send water back in the atmosphere.</p>
<p t="81920" d="3560">Between all those hot buildings, that cools things off.</p>
<p t="85580" d="1880">Another solution is color.</p>
<p t="87460" d="2720">Light colors reflect sunlight back into the atmosphere</p>
<p t="90180" d="1640">instead of storing it as heat.</p>
<p t="91820" d="2700">It&#39;s easiest to see in crosswalks,</p>
<p t="94520" d="1660">and it&#39;s true for the color of buildings</p>
<p t="96180" d="2740">and other urban surfaces, too.</p>
<p t="99260" d="2760">And one long-game way to combat the heat island effect</p>
<p t="102020" d="3220">is to avoid using air conditioning when you don’t need it.</p>
<p t="105700" d="3460">AC uses a ton of electricity and creates a feedback loop.</p>
<p t="109360" d="3580">When we get that electricity from coal or natural gas,</p>
<p t="112940" d="2520">that puts more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere …</p>
<p t="115460" d="1360">which warms the planet …</p>
<p t="116820" d="2260">making cities even hotter.</p>
<p t="120060" d="2220">But this isn’t just about comfort.</p>
<p t="122280" d="2000">Today, heat waves kill more people</p>
<p t="124280" d="2900">than any other extreme weather event.</p>
<p t="127180" d="3340">More than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods.</p>
<p t="131400" d="2220">City populations keep growing,</p>
<p t="133620" d="2980">and those cities are only getting hotter.</p>
